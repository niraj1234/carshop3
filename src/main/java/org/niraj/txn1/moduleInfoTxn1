This module is not related to carshop3 application.
Working fine.

This module is working fine. 
Ticket-Movie-User combination of data.
After booking request, money is deducted from table and numbers of ticket is also reduced.

But there is no check on the minimum amount of the Ticket and User money.
Hence movie ticket and user money is also getting reduced to negative values.

Future modification for this module is 
1. Add a check at movie total cost and check the minimum balance of user.
2. Also check the number of requested booking ticket is available or not.
